I love my bike. It was older, but I had rebuilt most of it at some point. Under the sodium lights of the parking lot, the long curve of the black fuel tank gleamed. I had stripped down, cafe racer style, with the fenders removed and a thin wedge of a seat. Over the years I had removed any unnecessary parts, and that left the engine exposed in a way that one could almost understand it as a model that showed the basics of how an internal combustion engine works. The one cylinder stood up rigidly in the middle of the bike. For some reason it always reminded me of the bicep of some body builder under tension in a flex position.
